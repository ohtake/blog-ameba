\#Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール) and #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) visited #Seibuen Amusement Park (#西武園ゆうえんち) in Saitama, Japan, on 2017-09-24. Hello Kitty celebrated #birthday for each child. Cinnamoroll sung his new song "Chu-Chu-Chu". He also presented an English lecture in a show "Learn ABC with Cinnamoroll" (シナモロールと一緒にABC). The show has been recently revised and its English difficulty raised a bit. I guess he has improved his English skills through the years of teaching English. #BSFuji (#BSフジ), a satellite television company in Japan, filmed dances by Cinnamorol and Hello Kitty, and broadcast Cinnamoroll's dance in a TV program called "#Sanrio Characters Ponpon Jump" @sanrio_ponponjump (#サンリオ キャラクターズ #ポンポンジャンプ) on 2017-10-01.

On 2017-10-01, #Pochacco (#ポチャッコ) presented his meet-and-greet at #KeikyuDepartmentstore (#京急百貨店), where #PochaccoCafe (#ポチャッコカフェ) is operating in a limited period of time since 2017-09-07. In this picture, he took crouching position to start a sprint run as the event organizer played a music of sports day.

On 2017-10-06, a new #Sanrio (#サンリオ) #Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール) #doll was released. The doll of Cinnamoroll holds a tiny #WishMeMell's (#ウィッシュミーメル) #MellMellDoll (#メルメルドール) in his hands. To commemorate the release, #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) held Cinnamoroll and Mell's photography event called "シナモン x メルメルドール お披露目ステージ \~撮影会なんだモン\~". Cinnamoroll and Mell held each other's doll in their hands, and everyone shot photos of them.

\#Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール), the #ambassador of Shinagawa Tourism Association (#しながわ観光協会 #しながわ観光大使 #しなバサダー), attended Shinagawa #Yumesanbashi (#しながわ夢さん橋) on 2017-10-08. Shinagawa Yumesanbashi is a yeary festival in #Shinagawa (#品川) ward and has 30-year history.

In Japan, some local public authorities have their original mascots or #YuruChara (#ゆるキャラ or #ご当地キャラ). Most of local mascots have name plates with their location names to promote their places. Stritly speaking, Cinnamoroll is not a local mascot but a #Sanrio (#サンリオ) character, however, he put on a blue tee shirt with "しながわ" text, hiragana repesentation of Shinagawa. He may look provincial but it is interesting in contrast to his usual cute costumes.

Other photos of the event are avaialble at Flickr album: <https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohtake_tomohiro/sets/72157687920839381>

On 2017-10-08, #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) visited @grand_tree_musashikosugi and promoted #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) #Halloween (#ハロウィン) events. The Halloween events in this year have two aspects: #cosplay (#コスプレ) in daytime and #horror (#ホラー) in nighttime.

Hello Kitty cosplayed #Alice (#アリス) in #AliceInWonderland (#不思議の国のアリス). She taught attendees how to dance in the new Sanrio Puroland Halloween parade "Halloween Ghost Ranger Parade" (#ハロウィーンゴーストレンジャーパレード). In contradiction to past parades, the new parade targets adult generations, mainly aged around twenty. At night, #Ghost #Clown (#ゴーストピエロ) occupies Sanrio Puroland and changes the atmosphere completely into fear. To defeat the ghost, participants must gather their power of love to Halloween parties (#パリピパワー).

\#MyMelody (#マイメロディ) had a dance and handshake event at @ariohashimoto on 2017-10-09. She revealed her new #Halloween (#ハロウィン) #umbrella (#傘) costume for the first time. #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) also has a resembled Halloween costume since last year. I hope both Hello Kitty and My Melody will participate in an event and show us the dual costumes at the same time.

After visiting Ario Hashimoto, I dropped in #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド). The new #Halloween (#ハロウィン) parade "Halloween Ghost Ranger Parade" (#ハロウィーンゴーストレンジャーパレード) has a significant scene. Six characters, #HelloKitty, #MyMelody, #Kuromi, #Cinnamoroll, #WishMeMell, and #PompomPurin (#ハローキティ, #マイメロディ, #クロミ, #シナモロール, #ウィッシュミーメル, #ポムポムプリン), form a row and troop around the #WisdomeTree (#知恵の木).

On 2017-10-14, I stopped off at #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) after I took an IELTS exam. Usually, Puroland presents #MiracleGiftParade (#ミラクルギフトパレード) once a day on weekdays and twice a day on weekends, however on that weekend, three times a day because #Mikihouse (#ミキハウス), an apparel brand for children, offered discount sales there. Thanks to the discount sales, a lot of people visited Puroland and enjoyed parades.

In the parade, #MySweetPiano (#マイスウィートピアノ), a sheep friend of #MyMelody (#マイメロディ), danced using #MiracleHeartLight (#ミラクルハートライト) on her hand.

On 2017-10-15, #Kuromi (#クロミ) and #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) visited #Seibuen Amusement Park (#西武園ゆうえんち). Unfortunately, all shows were cancelled due to rain. Instead of shows, they had meet-and-greet in a souvenir shop.

Kuromi dislikes #MyMelody (#マイメロディ) because Kuromi assumes My Melody is a rival. Once she found anybody wearing My Melody merchandise, she tried to rob them and throw away.

Through 2017-10-24 to 2017-10-27, #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) held #Kuromi's (#クロミ) #birthday #party "petit" version. Because of high demands for character birthday parties, it is hard to obtain a ticket. To resolve the issue, Puroland decided to hold a "petit" parties many times on weekdays. I attended one on 2017-10-26.

Amoung attendees of the party, there was a sleeping baby in a buggy. Kuromi tried to wake the baby up and amuse him or her. In spite of her kindness, the baby started crying. A crew had to drag Kuromi away from the baby.

He also visited #Hankyu #Oimachi Garden (#阪急大井町ガーデン), a department store near Oimachi Station. He attended an #illumination (#イルミネーション) kickoff ceremony (#点灯式) and switched the lights on. There is also an illumination statue of Cinnamoroll. The illumination will be available until 2018-01-08. Do not miss it.

Various disc jockeys played dance music through the night for those who love Halloween parties. There were also a lot of meet-and-greet for character lovers.

The most interesting meet-and-greet to me was one at #TangleTeezer (#タングルティーザー) booth. Tangle Teezer released a new hairbrush with #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) illustration. Hello Kitty herself tried the hairbrush on her own hand and then attendees compared hair smoothness of her hand.

\#SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) held #Kuromi's (#クロミ) #birthday #party "full" version on 2017-10-29 and 2017-10-31. I attended the former one.

They announced that Kuromi will introduce a new costume in the party. The new costume was called Naughty Melody (ワルメロディ). Though Kuromi hates #MyMelody (#マイメロディ), she was forced to be dressed as My Melody. Her cape was made of hook and loop fastner. Attendees of the party throwed My Melody plushies with hook and loop fastner, and tried to attach plushies to her.

There was also a photo session. In the photo session, Hello Kitty brought a whole cake and cut it in front of us.

\#HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) and #Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール) visited #Turfy (#ターフィー) at #JRA #TokyoRacecourse (#東京競馬場) on 2017-11-12.

Hello Kitty and other Sanrio characters often visited Tokyo Racecourse, however they had not provided a show there. Recently, JRA built a stage inside Tokyo Racecourse so that characters could have a show on the stage.

\#HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) attended #Keio #Ekiden Festival (#京王駅伝フェスティバル) at #AjinomotoStudium (#味の素スタジアム) on 2017-11-12. She played a starter role in ekiden races.

Crews of different roles in Japanese railway stations have their corresponding hats. Stationmasters (#駅長) have two gold lines on their hat. Vice stationmasters (助役) have one gold line. Since Hello Kitty is an honorary stationmaster (#名誉駅長) at #KeioTamaCenter station (#京王多摩センター), she has two gold lines on her hat.

Hello Kitty in the picture performed #PointingAndCalling (#指差喚呼), a method of checking safety commonly used in Japan, as if train cars are departing.

\#SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) rolled out two new #Christmas shows on 2017-11-10. These are "Christma Party -Where is the last 's' of Christmas-" (クリスマ☆パーティ
～｢ス｣が消えちゃった!?～) and "Hello Kitty Illumination Blue Snow Christmas -A gift from the angel-" (ハローキティ イルミネーション Blue Snow Christmas ～天使のおくりもの～). To watch the latter one, I visited Sanrio Puroland on 2017-11-12.

Blue Snow Christmas is an #illumination (#イルミネーション) show with #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ). She sings Christmas songs in the air. Illuminations on the #WisdomTree (#知恵の木) change its lighting to songs.

\#SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) rolled out two new #Christmas shows on 2017-11-10. These are "Christma Party -Where is the last 's' of Christmas-" (クリスマ☆パーティ
～｢ス｣が消えちゃった!?～) and "Hello Kitty Illumination Blue Snow Christmas -A gift from the angel-" (ハローキティ イルミネーション Blue Snow Christmas ～天使のおくりもの～). To watch the former one, I visited Sanrio Puroland on 2017-11-18.

Christma Party is a Christmas quasi-parade. Mind that there is no 's' at the end of "Christma". The missing 's' causes a lot of troubles. For instance, one of most famous Christmas songs "Let it snow" becomes "Let it now". #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) and other characters start to seek the lost 's'. Regular characters of the show are Hello Kitty, #DearDaniel (#ディアダニエル), #MyMelody (#マイメロディ), #Cinnamorol (#シナモロール), and #Pompompurin (#ポムポムプリン). The show also features two guest characters depending on day, #LittleTwinStars (#リトルツインスターズ #キキララ) or #Kuromi (#クロミ) and #WishMeMell (#ウィッシュミーメル).

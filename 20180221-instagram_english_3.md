Visited #GateOfChina in #Nanjing, #China. The city gate retains its original form for 650 years. #Cinnamoroll and #Hangyodon accompanied Fairilu, because both Cinnamoroll's symbol and 2-alpha country code of China are CN, and because Hangyodon was born in China.

\#BadtzMaru (#ばつ丸) and #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) visited #Seibuen Amusement Park (#西武園ゆうえんち) on 2017-12-10. Badtz Maru pretended he was #SantaClaus (#サンタクロース). At first, his carelessness led him to make some mistakes. For instance, he said he came from Hawaii and loved luxurious sushi at Ginza. Do you think he were finally able to cheat every attendees?

\#LittleTwinStars, Kiki and Lala (#キキララ), were born on 24 December. #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) held #birthday parties on 24 and 25 December 2017.

The party had a game. Participants threw sweet-shaped balls onto a target that Kiki and Lala held. Both balls and target were made of hook and loop fastener. If the number of balls attached on the target was greater than a threshold, Kiki and Lala would receive a prize. Two masters of celemonies stood in front of them to prevent balls from being attached using shields. Kiki was so greedy for the prize that he blocked a master of celemonies using his shoulder. She complained of Kiki's blocking but he did not stop it and finally got a prize.

\#KagamiMochi (#鏡餅) is traditional Japanese new year (#正月) decoration. It consists of two mochi, or #riceCake (#餅), and a #mikan (#みかん) on top of rice cakes. #Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール) has round head and fat body, which resemble rice cakes. Instead of his usual cup, he had a mikan on his head. He showed up on the stage and pretended to be kagami mochi. #Noranekoland (#ノラネコランド) suddenly appeared on the stage and tickled Cinnamoroll using various tools. Cinnamoroll was patient enough and continued mimicing kagami mochi.

Usually no other mascots do not participate in Anniversary Time, however My Melody attended the event as a guest. It was the very first try for a mascot. In the picture shown, she received an autograph by Hello Kitty.

Other special events were Happy Birthday Show, Non-stop greetings, Birthday Live, and Birthday Party. You can find photos on the day at <https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohtake_tomohiro/sets/72157691283443751>.

I visited #Hangzhou #HelloKitty Park (#杭州 Hello Kitty 乐园, 杭州 #ハローキティ パーク) in #Anji (#安吉) county, #Zhejiang (#浙江) province, #China (#中华人民共和国, #中華人民共和国, #中国). To enjoy the park in many aspects, I took 6-day holiday and planned to play in the park for four days.

It snowed heavily on the first day of my travel, and that made the park close temporarily. Park crew built a Hello Kitty #snowman to apologize all customers for the temporal close. I also wished the park to be opened, however, the park remained closed during whole my stay. That was so unfortunate but I would like to visit the park again.

Photos during the stay, from 2018-01-25 to 2018-01-30, are available at <https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohtake_tomohiro/sets/72157669312282339>.

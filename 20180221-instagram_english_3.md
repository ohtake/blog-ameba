\#中国 の #南京 にある #中華門 に行ってきた。650年前の城門がそのまま残ってる。中国の2文字国コードであるCNと同じ略称の #シナモロール と、中国生まれの #ハンギョドン も一緒。

Visited #GateOfChina in #Nanjing, #China. The city gate retains its original form for 650 years. #Cinnamoroll and #Hangyodon accompanied Fairilu, because both Cinnamoroll's symbol and 2-alpha country code of China are CN, and because Hangyodon was born in China.

\#BadtzMaru (#ばつ丸) and #HelloKitty (#ハローキティ) visited #Seibuen Amusement Park (#西武園ゆうえんち) on 2017-12-10. Badtz Maru pretended he was #SantaClaus (#サンタクロース). At first, his carelessness led him to make some mistakes. For instance, he said he came from Hawaii and loved luxurious sushi at Ginza. Do you think he were finally able to cheat every attendees?

To celebrate #HelloKitty's (#ハローキティ) birthday, #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) introduced four new costumes of her in November 2017. One of new costumes is "MEET THE 2 RIBBONS" (In Japanese, they do not distinguish ribbons and bows). Her overall and glasses have two bows. The red bow and the yellow bow denote Kitty and #Mimmy (#ミミィ) respectively. "MEET THE 2 RIBBONS" is also theme of #Sanrio's (#サンリオ) #CorporateSocialResonsibility in 2017 (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehGomp9soso>).

\#HelloKitty (#HelloKitty) visited Mitsui Outlet Park Iruma (#三井アウトレットパーク入間) on 2017-12-23 and 2017-12-24. Sanrio opened an outlet shop in the outlet mall since Octover 2017.

I told her that she looked comfortably warm because of her scarf and gloves, but she denied it. She felt cold because her sweater was sleeveless and her skirt was too short.

\#LittleTwinStars, Kiki and Lala (#キキララ), were born on 24 December. #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) held #birthday parties on 24 and 25 December 2017.

The party had a game. Participants threw sweet-shaped balls onto a target that Kiki and Lala held. Both balls and target were made of hook and loop fastener. If the number of balls attached on the target was greater than a threshold, Kiki and Lala would receive a prize. Two masters of celemonies stood in front of them to prevent balls from being attached using shields. Kiki was so greedy for the prize that he blocked a master of celemonies using his shoulder. She complained of Kiki's blocking but he did not stop it and finally got a prize.

\#KagamiMochi (#鏡餅) is traditional Japanese new year (#正月) decoration. It consists of two mochi, or #riceCake (#餅), and a #mikan (#みかん) on top of rice cakes. #Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール) has round head and fat body, which resemble rice cakes. Instead of his usual cup, he had a mikan on his head. He showed up on the stage and pretended to be kagami mochi. #Noranekoland (#ノラネコランド) suddenly appeared on the stage and tickled Cinnamoroll using various tools. Cinnamoroll was patient enough and continued mimicing kagami mochi.

One of new year's events in #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) is "Now is the time to cut off curses" (わるいのわるいのきるでござるタイム). In the event, a character acted as a #samurai and cut every guests to remove their cursed portions and minds.

On 2018-01-07, #Cinnamoroll (#シナモロール) played a samurai. He used a #katana (#刀) made of #dango 🍡 (#団子), Japanese sweet rice dumpling. Since his katana was made of dango, it made funny sounds when he cut guests.

\#MyMelody's (#マイメロディ) #birthday is 18 Jan. #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド) presented a lot of special events on 2018-01-18 to celebrate My Melody.

Most recent three shows in Märchen Theater, one of theaters in #SanrioPuroland (#サンリオピューロランド), are based on #AliceInWonderland (#不思議の国のアリス), #Oz (#オズ), and #NutCracker (#くるみ割り人形), respectively. #Takarazuka (#宝塚) Revue produced these shows in collaboration with Sanrio Puroland.

I visited #Hangzhou #HelloKitty Park (#杭州 Hello Kitty 乐园, 杭州 #ハローキティ パーク) in #Anji (#安吉) county, #Zhejiang (#浙江) province, #China (#中华人民共和国, #中華人民共和国, #中国). To enjoy the park in many aspects, I took 6-day holiday and planned to play in the park for four days.

It snowed heavily on the first day of my travel, and that made the park close temporarily. Park crew built a Hello Kitty #snowman to apologize all customers for the temporal close. I also wished the park to be opened, however, the park remained closed during whole my stay. That was so unfortunate but I would like to visit the park again.

Photos during the stay, from 2018-01-25 to 2018-01-30, are available at <https://www.flickr.com/photos/ohtake_tomohiro/sets/72157669312282339>.
